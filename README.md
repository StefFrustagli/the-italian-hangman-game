# THE ITALIAN HANGMAN GAME

*It's time to play the **Italian hangman game**!*
This is a Python terminal game that runs on Heroku's mock terminal created by the Code Institute.

This game is intended for intermediate Italian learners and for native Italian children who are learning to read and write. As instructions are given in English, basic English is also required.



## How to play
Save the little man from the Italian hangman by identifying the words correctly.  Ten ??? attempts are all you have, so think carefully. To simplify the choice of words, there are 3 categories to select from at the beginning of the game. 

*In Italy we play a wordy game so grand,* <br>
*It is the Hangman game! Where letters in the air stand.* <br>

*Trying guessing the hidden word, letter by letter,* <br> 
*and the poor man's fate - you'll make it so much better.* <br> 

*The keyboard is right there - be ready to play.* <br>
*Try your best - don't let the hangman swing today.* <br>
*From "A" to "Z," choose your letters with care,* <br>
*and remember: in Italian we don't use y or j or x.* <br>

*So guess away - don't let your chances slip,* <br>
*as the Italian Hangman, it's a challenging trip.* <br>
*Guess the word, solve the puzzle, and win the day!* <br>
*Or watch the hangman's noose, in the breeze, sway.*<br> ??? persona verbo corretta?
