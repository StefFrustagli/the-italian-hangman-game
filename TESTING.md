## Bugs resolved

The biggest problems I had were caused by function bugs. The parameters, arguments and values returned were incorrect, so I had to ensure I was using the correct ones.

 - For example, I had an issue with the restart_game function: when the player chose to play again, I returned the new random word and the number of attempts but did not update the word and num_attempts variables in the main loop. As a result, the main loop continued with the old word, and the game exited immediately. So I needed to make a small adjustment to the main function, replacing the word and num_attempts variables in the main loop with the values returned from the restart_game function, to ensure the word and num_attempts were updated. This solved the problem and the game worked as expected.

- Another issue in the main function caused the game to stop when restarted after the player selected a category. To fix this I had to replace the return statement inside the while True loop with 'continue' to keep the loop running.
